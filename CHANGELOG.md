# Changelog - ItemRack TBC Anniversary

All notable changes to the TBC Anniversary port of ItemRack will be documented in this file.

## [4.29.4] - 2026-03-01
### Bug Fixes
- **"Custom" Set Indicator**: Fixed a bug where the UI would refuse to update the set name to "Custom" when manually changing a piece of gear, getting "stuck" on the previous set's name. This occurred because Active Events (such as Mounting or Drinking) were forcefully suppressing the gear mismatch logic. Events will now properly unhook their gear UI lock if they detect you've actively swapped out any of the underlying event items.
- **Helm & Cloak Unequip**: Fixed an issue where the Show/Hide Helm and Cloak settings were being forgotten when unequipping a set to restore the previous gear. The fallback set (`~Unequip`) now correctly inherits the visibility settings of the previous set. (Thanks to [UDrew](https://github.com/UDrew/ItemRack-Anniversary/pull/3) for the fix!)

## [4.29.3] - 2026-02-28
### Bug Fixes
- **Macro Text Overlay on Buttons**: Fixed an issue where macro/action name text from Blizzard's action bar could appear overlaid on ItemRack quick access buttons. Since ItemRack buttons inherit `ActionBarButtonTemplate`, the template's `Name` FontString would display macro names from matching action bar slot IDs (e.g., a macro in slot 1 showing its name on the Head slot button). The `Name` FontString is now cleared, hidden, and permanently blocked from future writes on slots 0-19. Slot 20 (Set Button) is unaffected and continues to display the gear set name.

### Changed
- Added support for tracking instance types in Zone events (`ItemRackEvents.lua`). You can now just enter `arena`, `pvp`, `party`, or `raid` in the Zone event textbook and it properly works across all localized clients. (Thanks to [UDrew](https://github.com/UDrew/ItemRack-Anniversary/commit/a226d36ad1b1903c29e8fb357b41033320af415e) for the fork and foundation!)

## [4.29.2] - 2026-02-25
### Bug Fixes
- **Bottom Row Popout**: Reverted the popout rule for bottom-row character sheet items (Main Hand, Off Hand, Ranged, Ammo) that was unintentionally changed. They now correctly dock vertically by default as they used to.
- **Bottom Row Tooltip Overlap**: Fixed an issue where the new tooltip overlap-protection logic would drop tooltips directly onto vertical Weapon/Ammo menus. Tooltips now intelligently push to the left or right side of the menu based on screen position.
- **Orange Highlight Unequipped**: Fixed the logic for the `TooltipColorUnEquipped` setting. It now successfully detects simple un-enchanted item IDs across characters and correctly highlights items that are in your bags (but not in the active set) in orange on the Set Tooltip.

---

## [4.29.1] - 2026-02-25
### Bug Fixes
- **Specialization Re-equip Flicker**: Fixed an issue where zoning or reloading would cause ItemRack to aggressively re-equip spec-tied gear sets, overwriting manual gear changes (like equipping a shield).
  1. **Spec Priming**: ItemRack now primes its state on startup, recognizing the current specialization, stance, and zone to prevent redundant "new" swaps.
  2. **Zoning Guard**: Added protection against invalid spec indices (0) that occasionally flicker during loading screens.
  3. **State Tracking**: Converted Specialization and Zone events to use `.Active` flag tracking. This ensures that once a set is equipped for a spec/zone, ItemRack won't "fight" manual gear overrides until the player actually changes state.

### Improvements
- **Optimized Popout Menus**: Redesigned the popout menu (`BuildMenu`) logic to handle high item counts (like multiple necklaces/rings).
  - **Dynamic Wrapping**: Menus now automatically wrap into multiple columns when item counts are high (4/8/12/24 items), keeping the menu compact.
  - **Always to the Side**: Handled the "Always go to either side" rule for character sheet popouts on the left and right sides of the window. Weapon and Ammo slots deliberately remain untouched and continue to dock vertically.
  - **Screen Space Awareness**: Menus now calculate their height against the screen resolution, automatically adjusting column counts to ensure the entire menu remains visible and accessible.
- **Enhanced Tooltip Anchoring**: Improved `ApplyTooltipAnchor` to protect all ItemRack toolbar buttons. Tooltips now intelligently anchor away from screen edges and Blizzard's default UI elements to prevent overlap.

---

## [4.29] - 2026-02-25
### Bug Fixes
- **Action Bar Taint (ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED)**: Fixed a critical taint propagation issue that caused Blizzard action bar buttons (e.g. `MultiBar5Button1:SetShown()`) to break after opening the character sheet. Two root causes were addressed:
  1. **GameTooltip taint**: Temporarily replacing `GameTooltip.SetOwner` with an addon closure permanently flagged the table key as tainted, propagating through `OnEnter` → `UpdateShownButtons` → `SetShown`. Tooltip repositioning now occurs *after* the secure handler, using `ClearAllPoints`/`SetPoint` with alpha-hide to prevent visual snap.
  2. **Action bar dispatcher taint**: ItemRack buttons inheriting `ActionBarButtonTemplate` were registered with Blizzard's shared event dispatcher tables. Addon code touching these buttons propagated taint to all real action buttons. `ButtonOnLoad` now unregisters from `ActionBarButtonEventsFrame`, `ActionBarActionEventsFrame`, and related dispatchers.
- **Button Nil Errors**: Fixed `attempt to index field '?' (a nil value)` scaling errors that occasionally occurred on clients carrying over older profile data (e.g. Season of Discovery / Classic Era) when mousing over buttons or dragging them.

### Changed
- Improved macro functionality: `ItemRack.CreateMacro()` now uses a more flexible regex `string.find(text, "#showtooltip")` to detect proper macro prefixes and preserves spacing before tooltips, fixing issues with `#showtooltip` breaking.

### Improvements
- **Tooltip Highlight Unequipped**: Added a new setting "Highlight unequipped in tooltip" to the Options pane. When viewing a set's minimap or on-screen tooltip, items that are taking up inventory space but are not currently equipped are drawn in **Orange**, making it easy to see what items aren't on your character.
- **Improved Tooltip Placement**: Tooltips for popout menus on character-sheet slots now dynamically anchor to ensure they don't cover the buttons or the screen edges. Tooltips for right-side slots (Hands, Belt, etc) now fall down below the ItemRack menu to keep the buttons usable.

## [4.28] - 2026-02-14
### Bug Fixes
- **Tooltip Set Info ("Show set info in tooltips")**: Fixed an issue where hovering over items in your bags or character panel would inconsistently show or miss the "ItemRack Set:" label. The root cause was a strict full-string comparison that broke when the TBC Anniversary launch added extra fields to item strings. Replaced with a new `SameExactID` comparison that matches the first 8 item-identifying fields (itemID, enchant, gems, suffix, unique) while ignoring trailing context fields (level, spec). This correctly differentiates items with different enchants or gems, and is immune to item string format changes. Internal sets (`~Unequip`, `~CombatQueue`) are now also filtered from tooltips.

### Improvements
- **Blizzard Keybinding Integration**: All 20 equipment slots (0–19) are now registered in the Blizzard Keybindings panel under **AddOns > ItemRack**. Each slot has a descriptive label (e.g., "Head (Slot 1)", "Off Hand / Shield / Held In Off-hand (Slot 17)"). Added `Bindings.xml` for keybinding registration.
- **Improved Cooldown Display (Large Numbers)**: When "Large Numbers" is enabled in settings, cooldown text now uses a compact `mm:ss` / `h:mm` format with dynamic coloring: **white** (>60s), **yellow** (<60s), and **red** (<5s). Small numbers mode retains the original `30 s` / `2 m` / `1 h` format.
- **Native Countdown Suppression**: Suppressed WoW's built-in `CooldownFrame` countdown numbers on ItemRack buttons. The game's settings only allow disabling this for spells (not items), so ItemRack now explicitly calls `SetHideCountdownNumbers(true)` to prevent duplicate countdown text when using its own cooldown system.
- **Hotkey Display**: Improved keybinding text rendering on slot buttons — keys now display in a subtle gray (`0.6, 0.6, 0.6`) and are properly hidden when no key is bound. Added nil-safety checks for the hotkey font string.

## [4.27.5] - 2026-02-09
### Bug Fixes
- **Action Bar Interaction**: Fixed an issue where casting spells from the main action bar (slots 1-12) would inadvertently highlight/check corresponding ItemRack slots. This was caused by the underlying button template responding to action bar events; these event handlers have now been explicitly disabled for ItemRack buttons, including hiding the CheckedTexture and SpellActivationAlert elements.
- **Mounted-to-Casting Transitions**: Fixed an issue where gear set swaps would get stuck when transitioning from mounted to casting. The `SetsWaiting` queue was not being processed after casting ended, causing pending set changes to never execute. Re-enabled processing of waiting sets after both spell completion and the delayed combat queue.
- **Keybind Saving in Combat**: Improved combat handling for keybind saving. If a reload happens during combat, the keybind save operation is now queued to run automatically after combat ends, instead of failing silently.
- **Ammo Slot Nil Check**: Fixed a "bad argument #1" Lua error that occurred when `GetInventoryItemID` returned nil for empty slots (particularly the ammo slot). The error would trigger during buff event processing (e.g., mounting, drinking) when the addon scanned inventory slots. Added proper nil check before calling `GetItemInfo`.
- **Combat Queue UI Timing**: Fixed an issue where the set icon would briefly show "Custom" after combat ends, even though the correct set was equipped. This was caused by `UpdateCurrentSet()` being called immediately after combat queue items were equipped, before the item swap animation completed. Added a 0.5s delay to match the timing used for normal set swaps.

## [4.27.4] - 2026-02-03
### Event System Overhaul
- **Buff Event State Tracking**: Fixed an issue where temporary events (Mounting, Drinking) could get "stuck" or spam gear swaps. Added distinct `.Active` state tracking to ensure events properly unequip their gear when ending.
- **Nested Event Handling**: Implemented "stack splicing" logic to handle complex event transitions (e.g., Drinking ending while Mounted). The system now correctly restores the original gear state instead of reverting to an intermediate temporary set.
- **Stance Reliability**: Extended the `.Active` state tracking to Stance events (Shapesifting, Ghost Wolf), ensuring they cleanly revert gear even if the equipment API reports mismatches.
- **UI Label Stability**: The current set label/icon now correctly persists during active events (like "Zoomies") instead of reverting to "Custom" when `IsSetEquipped` fails falsely due to API inconsistencies.

## [4.27.3] - 2026-02-02
### Dual-Wield Timing Fix
- **Extended Retry Delay**: Increased the dual-wield weapon retry delay from 0.75 seconds to 5.5 seconds. The previous delay was too short to account for the 5-second spec change cast, causing the offhand weapon retry to trigger before dual-wield capability was granted.

### UI Options
- **Menu Docking Control**: Added two new options under "Character sheet menus" for controlling popout menu direction:
  - **Left slots: menu on right** — Flips left-side slots (Head, Neck, Shoulder, Back, Chest, Shirt, Tabard, Wrist) to show menus on the RIGHT
  - **Right slots: menu on left** — Flips right-side slots (Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet, Rings, Trinkets) to show menus on the LEFT
  - Bottom weapon slots (MainHand, OffHand, Ranged) always dock vertically and are unaffected

## [4.27.2] - 2026-02-01
### Dual-Wield Spec Awareness
- **Offhand Weapon Retry**: Added logic to detect when a spec change grants dual-wield capability (e.g., Enhancement Shaman, Fury Warrior). If the offhand weapon fails to equip during the initial set swap, ItemRack will automatically retry the weapon slots after a short delay.
- **Safe Implementation**: Uses `EquipItemByID` directly instead of temporary sets, avoiding queue conflicts that could break the addon.

### Stability Fixes
- **SetsWaiting Safety**: Added protection against deleted sets in the waiting queue. If a set in the queue no longer exists, it is now safely skipped instead of breaking subsequent swaps.
- **Simplified Combat Detection**: Streamlined the combat state check in `EquipSet` to avoid potential timing issues.

### Combat Queue Consistency
- **Manual Queue Cycling**: Right-clicking a slot button to cycle through the queue now properly uses the combat queue if you're in combat. Previously, this action would silently fail during combat.
- **Unified Combat Handling**: All gear-switching systems now consistently use `AddToCombatQueue()` when the player is in combat, dead, or casting. Items queued this way will automatically equip when combat ends.
- **Event Restoration During Combat**: Suppressed noisy "Could not find" error messages when events like Drinking end during combat. These messages were not actionable while fighting and cluttered the chat.

## [4.27.1] - 
### Queue System Fixes
- **Queue Duplicates**: Fixed an issue where items would duplicate in the queue list due to minor string ID mismatching. Now uses robust base-ID matching.
- **Stop Marker Fix**: Resolved a bug that caused multiple "Stop Queue Here" (red circle) markers to appear in the list.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Opening the queue menu now automatically detects and removes any existing duplicates or extra markers from saved data.

### UI & Layout Improvements
- **Smart Menu Docking**: Character sheet flyout menus for left-side slots (Head, Neck, Back, Chest, Shirt, Tabard, Wrist, Shoulder) now spawn to the **left** instead of the right, preventing overlap with tooltips or the character model.
- **Minimap Tooltip Anchor**: Repositioned the minimap button tooltip to the bottom-left of the button to ensure it doesn't obstruct the dropdown menu interactions.
- **Documentation**: Added a complete [CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md) reference guide accessible from the README.

## [4.27] - Dual Spec Support
### Core Refinements & Spec Switching
- **Specialization Automation Fix**: Implemented a 0.5s stability timer (`SpecChangeTimer`) for talent switches to prevent gear-swap race conditions.
- **Improved Event Handling**: Added `LastLastSpec` state tracking to prevent spec-based gear swaps from interfering with temporary events like **Drinking**, **Mounting**, or **Stance** changes.
- **Unequip Priority**: Optimized the unequip-then-equip flow during spec transitions to avoid slot conflicts.
- **Redundancy Filter**: Prevents unnecessary equip calls if the target set is already active, cleaning up chat/logs.

### Keybind Improvements
- **Right-Click Queue Cycling**: Fixed and improved manual queue cycling. Right-clicking a slot button now correctly swaps to the next item in that slot's queue using a simplified bag-search approach that bypasses ID matching issues.
- **Alt+Right-Click Queue Options**: Alt+Right-clicking a slot button now opens the Queue configuration panel for that slot.
- **Left-Click Item Use**: Left-clicking a slot button uses the equipped item (trinkets, on-use effects).
- **Alt+Left-Click Queue Toggle**: Alt+Left-clicking toggles the Auto-Queue system on/off for that slot.

### UI & Options Stability
- **Focus Preservation**: Fixed a bug where saving a set or equipping gear would cause the Options window to jump to the currently equipped set. The UI now maintains the user's current editing context.
- **Spec Checkbox Persistence**: Introduced `SpecDirty` tracking to ensure Primary/Secondary spec associations are saved reliably and loaded correctly in the Sets list. Spec checkboxes are now dynamically labeled with your talent tree name (e.g., "Holy", "Arms").
- **UI Spacing**: Adjusted dual-spec checkbox layout with a 4px overlap to ensure all functional buttons fit within the interface frame.

### Visual & Display Fixes
- **Item Count Logic**: Refined the display of item counts on buttons and flyout menus.
    - Stacks and charges are now always visible.
    - Standard gear (count: 1) correctly hides the count text.
    - **Ammo Slot**: Fixed a specific issue where the Ranged/Ammo slot would display a "0" when empty.
- **Flyout Menus**: Enabled item counts for all slots in popout menus to improve visibility for consumables and charged items.
